/**
 * JAVASCRIPT LOOPS
 *
 * Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met.
 * They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing collections of data.

 * WHY USE LOOPS?

 * Without loops, we would need to write repetitive code like this:

/**
 * TYPES OF LOOPS IN JAVASCRIPT
 *
 * 1. for loop - runs a specified number of times
 * 2. while loop - runs as long as a condition is true
 * 3. do-while loop - runs at least once, then continues as long as a condition is true
 */

/**
 * 1. FOR LOOP
 *
 * Syntax:
 * for (initialization; condition; update) {

 * - initialization: executed once before the loop starts
 * - condition: evaluated before each iteration; if false, the loop stops
 * - update: executed after each iteration

 * EXAMPLE: Printing only odd numbers from 1 to 20

 * The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division.
 * If a number % 2 equals 0, it's even. If it equals 1, it's odd.

 * PRACTICE EXERCISES:
 *
 * 1. Write a loop that prints the first 10 multiples of 3
 * 2. Write a loop that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100
